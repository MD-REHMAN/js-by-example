# Terminal

Open a terminal, and write

```console
node -v
// v16.13.12
```

if you don't get a version, the go through [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and get it done.

Once you have node in your system. Create a file name `hello.js` and write the hello-world code previously mentioned. The file should looks somewhat like below

```JavaScript,editable
// hello.js
console.log("hello world")
```

Open terminal on the same directory. And write node hello

```console
node hello
// hello world
```

Voila! You have created your very first node based hello world program.

> NOTE:
> Read about [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). If you want run the program anytime you do a change.
