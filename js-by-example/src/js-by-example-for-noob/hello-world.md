# Hello World

In a programing world, their is ritual which every new programer does. And i.e., write their very first **Hello World** program. So, lets get into it.

```javascript,editable
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler
// You can test this code by clicking the "Run" button over there ->

console.log("Hello World");
```

> NOTE:
> You can also edit the examples. Let see what happens when you change `Hello World` to your name and re-run the example.

Let's understand what is happening. The above code can be broken down into 3 parts.

- [console](#console)
- [log](#log)
- ["Hello World"](#hello-world-1)

### `console`<br/>

It is one the Global object, which provides us with methods to interact with console.

To open console just press `Option + âŒ˜ + J` (on macOS), or `Shift + CTRL + J` (on Windows/Linux). And re-run the code. You'll see `Hello World` there as well.

We'll look this in detail when we start with [object]().

### `log`

It is one the methods in the `console` object, which let us write on console.

### `"Hello World"`

It is called **argument**. An argument is a way for you to provide more information to a function.

And this argument of type **string**, one of the [Primitive](). Let's learn more about it.
