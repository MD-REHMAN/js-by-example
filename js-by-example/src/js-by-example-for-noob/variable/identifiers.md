# Identifiers

The names you assign to these variables are called Identifiers.

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter, $ or \_.
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
