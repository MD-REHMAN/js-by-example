# Operators

Operators are the symbols between values that allow different operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. JavaScript has dozens of operators, so letâ€™s focus on the ones youâ€™re likely to see most often.

## Assignment

Operators like `=`.

We have already seen this operator in [variable]() section, and this operator assigns values.

```javascript,editable
// Here we assigned the value `hello` to the variable named `message`.
let message = "hello"
console.log(message)
```

## [Arithmetic](/operators/arithmetic.md)

Operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.

```javascript,editable
// Simple example to show all Arithmetic operators
let simple_math = 1/1*1-1+1;
console.log(simple_math)
```

> **NOTE:**
> Arithmetic operators follows the [BODMAS rule](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+BODMAS), thus the order in which you write them is ir-relevant.

## [Logical Operators](/operators/logical.md)

Operators like `==` , `===`, `!=` , `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`

```javascript,editable

```

## [Conditional Operators](/operators/conditional.md)

Operators like `||` , `!` and `&&`

```javascript,editable

```

## [Bitwise Operators](/operators/bitwise.md)

Operators like `|` , `!` and `&`

```javascript,editable

```

## The Nullish Coalescing Operator

The ?? operator returns the first argument if it is not nullish (null or undefined).

Otherwise it returns the second argument.

```javascript,editable
let name = null;
let text = "missing";
let result = name ?? text;
```

## The Optional Chaining Operator (?.)

The ?. operator returns undefined if an object is undefined or null (instead of throwing an error).

```javascript,editable
const ninja = {name:"Naruto", chakra_nature:["wind"], clan:"Uzumaki", village: "Leaf"};
console.log(ninja?.name)
console.log(ninja?.weakness)
```
