This is the source code of the traditional Hello World program.

```javscript,editable
  console.log("Hello World");
```

> NOTE:
> Click on the play button is the editor, to run the code. You can also edit the examples and try out all the **what-if**.

console.log is the function that prints text to the console.

But beside this editor, where can I ran JavaScript code??

I will tell you 3 places where you can run this code.

- [Browser](/hello/browser.md)

- [Online tools](/hello/online-playground.md)

- [Terminal](/hello/terminal.md)(recommended)
